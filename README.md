# PasswordGenerator
Developed a Python-based secure password generator to address weak and reused passwords. The tool accepts a user-defined length (min. 8 chars per NIST guidelines) and generates a random password with at least one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character, ensuring strong, secure credentials.
