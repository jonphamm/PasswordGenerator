**Secure Password Generator – Project Overview**

In today's increasingly digital and security-conscious environment, the ability to generate strong, reliable passwords is critical to protecting sensitive user data and online assets. Recognizing the widespread issue of weak or reused passwords, I developed a secure password generator designed to automate the creation of complex, random passwords that align with modern security standards.

This application accepts user input for the desired password length—enforcing a minimum of eight characters as recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The tool programmatically constructs a password that satisfies key complexity requirements: it includes at least one uppercase letter, one numerical digit, and one special character, ensuring robustness against common attack vectors such as brute-force and dictionary attacks.

By integrating user-defined parameters with security best practices, this project demonstrates my focus on usability, compliance, and practical cybersecurity principles. It reflects my capability to build tools that address real-world user behavior while upholding technical standards in software development.
